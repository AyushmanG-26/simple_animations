### 🚀 Stateless Animation

Stateless Animation provides a powerful set of Flutter widgets that hide the most complex part of creating animations.

**Example**: Square with an animated background color.

### 🎭 Timeline Tween

Timeline Tween (successor of [MultiTween](doc/multi_tween.md)) is a mighty tool thats enables you to tween multiple
properties *or* designing staggered animations in a single `Animatable`.

**Example**: Custom tween with multiple properties.

### 🎥 Anicoto

Anicoto fully manages your AnimationController instances and handles initialization, configuration and disposing. No
more boilerplate code.

**Example**: Animated stateful widget with full-fledged AnimationController instance.

### ⏯ Animation Developer Tools

Tired of watching the same animation over and over again, in order to fine tune it?

![devtools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felixblaschke/simple_animations_documentation_assets/master/v2/devtools.gif)

The Animation Developer Tools allows you pause anywhere, scroll around, speed up, slow down or focus on a certain
interval of the animation.
